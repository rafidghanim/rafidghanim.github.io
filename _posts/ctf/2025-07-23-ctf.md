## What is CTF?

**Capture The Flag (CTF)** is a cybersecurity competition where participants solve challenges to find hidden strings called "flags" (e.g., `CTF{you_found_me}`). It is a fun and educational way to learn about hacking, security vulnerabilities, cryptography, and forensics.

## Types of CTF Competitions

CTF competitions usually come in three main formats:

### 1. Jeopardy-style
Participants are given a board of challenges divided into categories like:
- **Crypto** – Cryptographic puzzles
- **Pwn** – Binary exploitation
- **Web** – Web application vulnerabilities
- **Reverse Engineering** – Analyze and reverse software
- **Forensics** – Investigate data, memory dumps, etc.
- **Misc** – Random or fun challenges

Each challenge has a point value based on difficulty. The team with the highest score wins.

### 2. Attack-Defense
Teams are given vulnerable services to protect while trying to exploit those of others. It involves:
- **Defending** your own services
- **Attacking** and stealing flags from opponent services

### 3. Mixed / Custom Format
Some competitions combine both styles or create their own unique challenge format.
